                    <p class="i8"><b>Ernesto Guevara</b> was born to<i> Ernesto Guevara Lynch</i> and<i> Celia de la Serna y Llosa</i>, on <i>14 June 1928</i>,in Rosario, Argentina. Although the legal name on his birth certificate was<u> "Ernesto Guevara"</u>,his name sometimes appears with "de la Serna" and/or "Lynch" accompanying it.He was the eldest of five children in an upper-class Argentine family of pre-independence immigrant Spanish (Basque, Cantabrian), and Irish ancestry.Two of Guevara's notable 18th century ancestors included Luis María Peralta, a prominent Spanish landowner in colonial California, and Patrick Lynch, who emigrated from Ireland to the Río de la Plata Governorate.Referring to Che's "restless" nature, his father declared "the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels".</p>
                    <p>
                       <b> Ernesto Guevara</b> spent just over nine months in Guatemala. On<i> 7 July 1953</i>, Guevara set out again, this time to <i> Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras</i>, and <i>El Salvador</i>. On 10 December 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his aunt Beatriz from San José, Costa Rica. In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing the dominion of the United Fruit Company, a journey which convinced him that the company's capitalist system was disadvantageous to the average citizen.He adopted an aggressive tone to frighten his more conservative relatives, and the letter ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then-recently deceased Joseph Stalin, not to rest until these "octopuses have been vanquished".Later that month, Guevara arrived in Guatemala, where President Jacobo Árbenz headed a democratically elected government that, through land reform and other initiatives, was attempting to end the latifundia agricultural system. To accomplish this, President Árbenz had enacted a major land reform program, where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be appropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The largest land owner, and the one most affected by the reforms, was the<i> United Fruit Company</i>, from which the Árbenz government had already taken more than 225,000 acres (91,000 ha) of uncultivated land.Pleased with the direction in which the nation was heading, Guevara decided to make his home in Guatemala to<i> "perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary."</i></p>
